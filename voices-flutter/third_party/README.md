# Drt ONNX Runtime (ort)

Enabling cross-platform ONNX Runtime (ORT) in Flutter powered by Rust.

Under-the-hood this library uses the amazing rust library [ort](https://ort.pyke.io/) by [pyke](https://pyke.io/). Then
[flutter_rust_bridge](https://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/) is used to help make this communication easier.

## ONNX Runtime binaries

Prebuilt binaries are available for all platforms and can be found at [dart-ort-artifacts](https://github.com/NathanKolbas/dart-ort-artifacts).
They are downloaded during compile time when creating the binaries for this library.

> 🗒️ You typically do not need to worry about this since binaries are created for this library that statically link the 
> onnxruntime and are downloaded during compile time (if available).

You are more than welcome to use your own binaries. Simply set the `ORT_LIB_LOCATION` environment variable to the
location of your own static-binaries.

> ⚠️ I am having issues getting Windows binaries to work. In the meantime pyke's binaries will be used for Windows ⚠️
>

## Execution Providers

Execution providers depend on the platform and which were compiled. Each platform has certain execution providers 
compiled by default.

You can find more information here: [dart-ort-artifacts](https://github.com/NathanKolbas/dart-ort-artifacts).

> 🗒️ If you would like specific execution providers to be built-in by default feel free to make an issue so this can be discussed more!

Here is a matrix breakdown:

[//]: # (https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/eps.html)
[//]: # (CUDA, TensorRT, oneDNN, OpenVINO, QNN, DirectML, ACL, ANN, RKNPU, AMD Vitis AI, AMD MIGraphX, NNAPI, CoreML, XNNPACK, CANN, Azure)

| Platform | Execution Providers |
|----------|---------------------|
| Android  | NNAPI, XNNPACK      |
| iOS      | CoreML, XNNPACK     |
| Linux    | OpenVINO, XNNPACK   |
| MacOS    | CoreML, XNNPACK     |
| WASM     | WebGPU              |
| Windows  | DirectML, XNNPACK   |

If an execution provider is not available we fall back to CPU (this is how pyke's ort rust library works).

## Platform Breakdown

You can find more information about each platform below.

### Android

The minimum SDK is 28. While you can go lower, this is best for performance.

### iOS

The minimum iOS version is 15. While you can go lower, this is best for performance.

### Linux

glibc ≥ 2.35 & libstdc++ >= 12 (Ubuntu ≥ 22.04, Debian ≥ 12 ‘Bookworm’)

### MacOS

MacOS 13.3 or greater.

### WASM

Comes bundled with the WebGPU execution provider.

### Windows

> ⚠️ ARM Support is disabled for the time being until build can be fixed. ⚠️

Supports Windows 10 and 11.

OpenVINO does not have builds for arm64. npm distribution states "Windows ARM is not supported".

## Setup

Once you have added the library

```shell
flutter pub add ort
```

> 🗒️ `flutter` is used in the command until Dart's Code Assets are working then you can use dart/flutter.

Initialize ort with:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Ort.ensureInitialized();
  
  // ...
}
```

`Ort.ensureInitialized` providers several options for initialization, such as `throwOnFail`, so don't forget to check it
out!

## Usage

Some common info and usage of this library.

```dart
const matmulModel = [
  8, 9, 18, 0, 58, 55, 10, 17, 10, 1, 97, 10, 1, 98, 18, 1, 99, 34, 6, 77, 97,
  116, 77, 117, 108, 18, 1, 114, 90, 9, 10, 1, 97, 18, 4, 10, 2, 8, 1, 90, 9,
  10, 1, 98, 18, 4, 10, 2, 8, 1, 98, 9, 10, 1, 99, 18, 4, 10, 2, 8, 1, 66, 2,
  16, 20
];

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Ort.ensureInitialized();

  const List<double> vec = [1, 2, 3];
  final tensorA = Tensor.fromArrayF32(data: vec);
  final tensorB = Tensor.fromArrayF32(data: vec);

  // You can directly modify the Tensor's data from dart!
  tensorA.data[1] = 42.0;

  // You can load an ONNX model from memory!
  final session = await Session.builder().commitFromMemory(matmulModel);

  // output is Map<String, Tensor<dynamic>>
  final output = await session.run(inputValues: {
    'a': tensorA,
    'b': tensorB,
  });
  
  print(output['c']?.data);
  // [94.0]
}
```

### Tensor

The most commonly used is the `Tesnor` class. Some tricks to know is that the `data` field in the `Tensor` class under 
the hood points to the same location as the `Tensor`'s memory. While it appears as a `List<T>` on the dart side making 
it super easy to work with, you can directly modify the Tensor from dart! As long as the `Tensor` resides in CPU 
accessible memory of course :)

### Session

You can load an ONNX model from both memory (`Session.builder().commitFromMemory`) and file 
(`Session.builder().commitFromFile`).

A quirk to be aware of if you are trying to get the maximal amount of performance:

When `Session` `run` is used the`Tensor` is dropped. This is because Rust ends up dropping it from memory when passed 
from dart to rust. To "fix" this in the meantime (more like a workaround) we clone the `Tensor` on the Dart side before 
passing it to Rust. You can disable this behavior by setting `doNotClone` in `run` to true.

So while you don't need to worry about this since by default the `Tensor` is cloned it might be helpful to you due to
performance (while negligible). An issue tracking this is here: https://github.com/NathanKolbas/ort_dart/issues/2.
